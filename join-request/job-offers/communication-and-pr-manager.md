### **More about us:**

As young and small as Request Network may be, we believe in the calm of a master. We look at the essence of what we do and what we want to achieve. We need to manage our energy because we want to bring change. Big change. We waste no calories on building castles in the air or shiny headquarters on earth. We create the open network for all financial transactions.

As dynamic and thrilling the developing universe of blockchain may be, we stay true to our ambition and drive. We pivot and change when needed. But we don’t chase every attractive opportunity. Only when it contributes to our main goal.  
As seductive as the attraction of fame, fortune and a metropolitan life may be \(and the blockchain world is full of that\) we are happy to see that it adds to our attraction as a foundation. But doesn’t create a distraction from our mission. It can be a result, but it is certainly not our purpose.

To summarise it in simple words: we are here to create the ecosystem of the future, not to hang around in the egosystem of the past.  
This calm, perhaps serious attitude is not less powerful. Or less joyful. On the contrary. It’s just more authentic.  
  
People are smart enough to see the difference. And what counts is not who we are, but what we bring forward.
