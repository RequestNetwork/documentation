## Monorepo

The[ repository](https://github.com/RequestNetwork/requestNetwork) of the protocol is a monorepo, using [yarn workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/) and [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna). It holds every package composing the typescript implementation of the protocol, as well as the specifications.

## Building and Running

### Build all packages

1. `git clone https://github.com/RequestNetwork/requestNetwork.git`
2. `yarn run build`

Sometimes it helps to run `yarn run build:tsc` to fix typescript build problems.

### Lint all packages

1. `git clone https://github.com/RequestNetwork/requestNetwork.git`
2. `yarn run lint`
3. `yarn run packageJsonLint`

### Run all the tests

1. `git clone https://github.com/RequestNetwork/requestNetwork.git`
2. Console 1: Run IPFS
   1. Install and setup an IPFS node
   2. `ipfs daemon`
3. Console 2: Run ganache
   1. `cd packages/ethereum-storage`
   2. `yarn run ganache`
4. Console 3: deploy the contracts and run the tests
   1. `cd packages/ethereum-storage`
   2. `yarn run deploy`
   3. `cd ../`
   4. `yarn run test`

### CircleCI Build

We use CircleCI to build the projects of the monorepo: [https://circleci.com/gh/RequestNetwork/requestNetwork](https://circleci.com/gh/RequestNetwork/requestNetwork)
