# Am I eligible?

We’re targeting skilled teams and have high expectations on focus and quality.

In your application, we will ask for the following information:

* Describe your project in one sentence.
* Describe it in detail.
* Link to the website or add any relevant link.
* What is the goal of the project?
* Who are the team members, how did you meet, and what did you manage to build so far?
* What is it that made you want to start this project?
* How long have you been working on this and how advanced is the project? \(prototype, alpha, beta, …\)
* Describe the timeline and milestones.
* What is the estimated total overall budget and grant amount requested?
* Have you incorporated or formed any legal entity?
* Submit your contact details.

If we’re interested, we might ask for additional details.

There will be an application review by qualified community members, and a review by the foundation.

If your project qualifies, you can expect two responses within 21 days:

**A.** You are eligible for a grant \(ETH and REQ vesting\).  
**B.** We need more information, which could result in point A at a later point in time.
