# Xero \(upcoming\)

With Request, the invoicing software industry is one step further on the way towards electronic invoicing. E-invoicing is a paradigm in which invoices are shared, detected, approved and paid with a new kind of consensus. Companies save a lot of time dealing with their client and providers invoices \(Purchase Accountables and Sales Accountables\), and they can drive their treasury with more precision.

The Request Foundation is currently working on a Xero plugin with reconciliation options. [Have a look at our blog for updates!](https://request.network/blog)
